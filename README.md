# Industrial Work Area Generation using Fine-Tuned LLMs

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This thesis addresses a critical gap in layout generation by developing a method to generate industrial work areas using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project explores how fine-tuned LLMs can create functional industrial layouts when real-world data is unavailable.
